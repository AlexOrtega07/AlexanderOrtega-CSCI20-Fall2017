Have computer select a number between 0-19.
Randomized number is selected by computer.
Only computer knows the randomized number.
User will need to select a program capable of attempting to guess the number chosen by the computer.
Once the program is selected, The user will implement the parameters 0-19 for the program to guess between.
The user will start off with a total point tally of 10.
In the event of the program guessing correctly when run the first time, the user wins.
However, if the program is incorrect the computer should notify the program whether to guess higher or lower.
The user will also lose 1 point from their tally of 10 for each incorrect number guessed by the program.
The user will repeatedly run the program until the correct answer is provided.
Once the correct answer is provided, the user "wins"
However, if the user runs out of points (goes from 10-0) they "lose".
Run the program with the input parameters.
Repeat step 13 (while following the point rules) until the user either "wins" or "loses".
